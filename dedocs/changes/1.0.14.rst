Version 1.0.14
==============

Fixed bugs:

- Some more edge cases occured in 
  :mod:`watch_tim <lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.management.commands.watch_tim>`.
  Details in
  :mod:`watchtim_tests <lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.tests.watchtim_tests>`.

- When manually creating a Coaching, 
  the default value for the `user` field wasn't 
  correctly set to the requesting user
  (leading to a "DoesNotExist at /api/pcsw/CoachingsByClient" traceback).
  
- "You have no permission to delete this row." when working as somebody else.
