Version 1.0.15
==============

- Unknown HTTP method 'OPTIONS'

- "cercle vicieux" wegen Fehlalarm "Date range overlaps with ISIP #1".
  Wrote new testcase 
  :func:`test02 <lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.tests.pcsw_tests.test02>`.
  
- Tx25 kennt jetzt "Pseudo-Nationalnummern" (PseudoNationalNumbers)

- watch_tim: 
  Had to completely rewrite 
  :meth:`swapclass <lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.management.commands.watch_tim.PAR.swapclass>`
  because it wasn't able to handle conversion situations 
  (1) from Household to Client
  or (2) from Person to Household
